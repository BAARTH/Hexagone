            <p>The Hexagon Society offers a revisited and humanist approach to philosophical and talmudic knowledge, but also social sciences and arts in every sense, by a revisited study in new formats.<br />
<br />
On the cultural aspect, the Hexagon Society proposes a new space of intellectual creation that offers cultural content in every sense (debates, talks with experts, airing of pieces of theatre/film, conferences on philosophy, literature and geopolitics, meetings with artists).<br />
<br />
On the charitable aspect, the Hexagon Society works with a network of English and French charities in putting their service into a cultural context. (Meir Panim, Tsedaka, Norwood, Tsedek, H&acirc;tif, Ohel Sarah).<br />
<br />
The Hexagon Society also practises public affairs activity, in putting this large network in the middle of public affairs, in order to facilitate the meeting between public and private organisations. The charities, an integral part of civil society, see themselves offering the possibility to meet senior levels of decisions, with the single aim to have a better understanding of the supported cause. In this way, the talks can be organised in parliament to meet with the embassy. The Hexagon Society therefore relies on an important network to inspire our content and initiatives.

            <p>Facing a civilisation losing their ideological landmarks, dominated by the diktat of nihilism, consumeristic escheat, the Hexagon Society constitutes and essential force against existential emptiness and inherent moral for the western man of the 21st century.
                <br />
                <br /> The Hexagon Society is inspired by the &lsquo;Age of Enlightenment&rsquo; and embodies the belief that culture constitutes a universal vector for the promotion of a country and against obscurantism. The Hexagon Society is also inspired by English psyche and Ted conferences in the USA, in organising conferences on many different themes.
                <br />
                <br /> But also, and acting as the common denominator of the two ideas, the Hexagon Society is inspired by the Jewish Spirit in every sense, which advocates study and knowledge in order to obtain a clear reflection of the world in which we are in.
                <br />
                <br /> This is why The Hexagon Society benefits from the support of Bernard-Henri L&eacute;vy, after the success of his memorable talk on his book &lsquo;The Spirit of Judaism&rsquo;, and other important French and English intellectuals.
                <br />
                <br /> OUR SPECIFICITY
                <br />
                <br /> The Hexagon Society systematically engages and associates their events with a cause, in order to develop the custom of &lsquo;responsible entertainment&rsquo;.
                <br />
                <br /> By the following actions, the Hexagon Society puts together six areas:
                <br />
                <br /> The cultural or artistic project
                <br /> The recipient cause
                <br /> The public personality in their network
                <br /> The appropriate audience
                <br /> Production/promotion of the event
                <br /> The sponsors</p>
