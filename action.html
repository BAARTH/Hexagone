            <p>The Hexagon Society offers a revisited and humanist approach to philosophical and talmudic knowledge, but also social sciences and arts in every sense, by a revisited study in new formats.
                <br />
                <br /> On the cultural aspect, the Hexagon Society proposes a new space of intellectual creation that offers cultural content in every sense (debates, talks with experts, airing of pieces of theatre/film, conferences on philosophy, literature and geopolitics, meetings with artists).
                <br />
                <br /> On the charitable aspect, the Hexagon Society works with a network of English and French charities in putting their service into a cultural context. (Meir Panim, Tsedaka, Norwood, Tsedek, H&acirc;tif, Ohel Sarah).
                <br />
                <br /> The Hexagon Society also practises public affairs activity, in putting this large network in the middle of public affairs, in order to facilitate the meeting between public and private organisations. The charities, an integral part of civil society, see themselves offering the possibility to meet senior levels of decisions, with the single aim to have a better understanding of the supported cause. In this way, the talks can be organised in parliament to meet with the embassy. The Hexagon Society therefore relies on an important network to inspire our content and initiatives.
